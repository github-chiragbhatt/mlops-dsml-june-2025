- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## 2. Class Design
- Keep classes focused and cohesive
- Encapsulate fields with proper access modifiers
- Follow naming conventions consistently
- Use meaningful and descriptive names

## 3. Code Organization
- Maintain clear class hierarchies
- Group related classes in packages/modules
- Separate interfaces from implementations
- Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow

## 4. Methods
- Keep methods short and focused
- Follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Use clear parameter names
- Return clean, predictable values

## 5. Error Handling
- Use exceptions appropriately
- Handle errors at the right level
- Avoid catching generic exceptions
- Provide meaningful error messages

## 6. Documentation
- Document public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Keep comments current and relevant
- Use clear commit messages

## 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for each class
- Test edge cases
- Keep tests independent
- Follow arrange-act-assert pattern
